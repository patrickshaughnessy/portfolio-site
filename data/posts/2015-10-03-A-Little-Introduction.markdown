Hello World!

This is my first blog post for my github pages site built with Jekyll and Twitter Bootstrap.

I’ll be updating this blog periodically with anecdotes and miscellaneous learnings on my journey to become a full-stack web developer.

To fill out the website with my first three posts, as well as gain some experience using Markdown, I’m going to write about Markdown syntax and a tough recursive algorithm I learned recently.

Stay tuned for more!
