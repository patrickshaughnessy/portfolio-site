In this post I'll be exploring some Markdown syntax by creating a blog post about Markdown syntax. _It’ll be like Markdown Inception!!_

###### _Whoa!_

# Headers

Headers are very important and can be efficiently executed with hashes. H1 and H2 elements can also be “underlined” using equal signs or dashes, but I think hashes are more functional.

# Lists N’ Things

Here are some things I don’t like:

* Waking up before sunrise
* iPhone battery life
* Making lists of things I don’t like

What I’d like to have for lunch today (in order of preference):

1. Burrito
2. Sandwich
3. Pho

# Code Blocks

Writing code to be read onscreen in \`HTML\` sucks. Let me demonstrate.

	<p>
	  First you put some code inside the tags
	  <br>
	  Don’t forget to escape special characters
	  <br>
	  <pre><code>

	  var i = {
	    amThe: function(str){
	      if (str === 'CoolestDude’){return true;}
	    }
	  };

	  i.amThe('CoolestDude');

	  </code></pre>
	</p>

Wow, that escalated quickly.
